## Goals for the Month

> Define the project concept and core operational model.

> Establish project scope and expectations through the Statement of Work.

> Set up the technical foundation for development and documentation.

> Create initial structure for the admin and public-facing systems.

## Work Completed

> Finalized the Statement of Work outlining the BizRush model, where store employees handle shopping and drivers handle delivery only.

> Established the core system concept, positioning the platform as a logistics and orchestration layer between business owners, stores, and drivers.

> Set up the public-facing documentation website using Astro.

> Created the initial Flutter project structure, including an early admin/test site.

> Began development and iteration on the admin page to support future operational needs.

## Challenges / Blockers

During Month 1, the primary challenge involved transitioning the project to a Docker-based development environment. Initial issues arose during the setup process and when launching the Android emulator, which caused temporary delays. These challenges required additional troubleshooting to ensure the system was stable, reproducible, and properly configured before development could continue smoothly.

## Key Learnings

Month 1 highlighted the importance of establishing a stable and consistent development foundation early in the project. Investing time in documentation, environment standardization, and system planning helped reduce long-term risk and improved team alignment. The team also learned that clearly separating responsibilities between stores and drivers is essential to improving order accuracy and operational efficiency.

## Next Steps

Alex: Create UI mockups in Figma to define the visual direction and user experience for the Business Owner and Driver applications.

Tidiane: Continue enhancing the public-facing documentation site as the BizRush platform evolves and further develop the admin page to support upcoming core functionality in Month 2.

Bennett: Begin development of the two mobile applications (Business Owner and Driver) and start implementing the mocked API endpoints needed to support initial workflows.
