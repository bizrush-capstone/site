title: Project Overview
description: This project is a business-to-business pickup-to-delivery marketplace designed to help business owners quickly restock essential items they are short on. The platform connects business owners with nearby retail stores and independent drivers. Store employees locate and prepare items, while drivers handle only the pickup and delivery process.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to reduce order inaccuracies and fulfillment errors commonly experienced by business owners when using traditional delivery platforms. In many existing solutions, drivers are responsible for shopping for items, which often leads to incorrect substitutions, missing items, or incomplete orders due to limited product and store knowledge. This project addresses that issue by removing shopping responsibilities from drivers and assigning item selection and preparation to store employees who have direct knowledge of inventory and products. By doing so, the platform aims to improve order accuracy, reliability, and trust for business owners who rely on urgent restocking.

## Problem We Are Solving

Business owners who rely on third-party delivery platforms frequently experience inaccurate or incomplete orders due to the way those platforms assign shopping responsibilities. Drivers, who often lack detailed store knowledge and familiarity with inventory, are expected to locate, substitute, and verify items under time pressure. This results in incorrect substitutions, missing items, and inconsistent fulfillment, which can disrupt business operations and lead to lost time and revenue. There is currently a gap in delivery solutions that prioritize order accuracy for business-critical restocking needs.

## Timeline

### Month 1: 
Focused on project planning and foundation setup. Key outcomes included defining the project scope and objectives, creating the Statement of Work, establishing the initial Flutter project structure, setting up a public-facing documentation site using Astro, and creating an initial admin/test site using Flutter. This phase also included designing core system architecture through diagrams and database modeling.

### Month 2: 
Planned development phase. Detailed updates will be provided as this phase progresses.

### Month 3: 
Planned integration and stabilization phase. Detailed updates will be provided upon execution of this phase.

## Success Metrics

### Current Success (Month 1):
Success to this point has been measured by the completion of foundational deliverables. This includes a finalized Statement of Work, a functioning public-facing documentation site built with Astro, an initial Flutter project structure, and a working admin/test site. Additionally, core system architecture artifacts such as use cases, diagrams, and database models have been completed, confirming that the project is properly scoped and technically viable.

### Ongoing and Future Success (Months 2–3):
Future success will be measured by the delivery of core MVP functionality. This includes the ability for business owners to place restocking orders, stores to prepare and mark orders as ready, drivers to accept and complete deliveries, and administrators to monitor order status. Additional success indicators include stable builds across applications, reliable backend communication, and successful end-to-end workflow testing within the defined MVP scope.
